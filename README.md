# CNN_weather_notebook
Multi-class weather recognition using CNN

This project focuses on the classification of weather conditions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset used in this project is the "Multi-class Weather Dataset for Image Classification" available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of images representing four specific moments of the day, and the objective is to classify them into the corresponding moment of the day.

Files Included
CNN_Weather_Notebook.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the source code for the CNN-based weather classification. It includes data preprocessing, model architecture definition, model training, and evaluation.

Multi-class Weather Dataset: The dataset used in this project, which includes images representing different weather conditions and moments of the day. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link: Multi-class Weather Dataset

README.md: This file.

Instructions
To run the project, please follow these steps:

Download the necessary files from the repository to your local machine.

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Open the CNN_Weather_Notebook.ipynb notebook.

Ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed, such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. You can install them using the command !pip install [library name] if needed.

Load the Multi-class Weather Dataset into the notebook from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/multi-class-weather-dataset.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and perform weather classification using CNNs.

The notebook will guide you through data preprocessing, model architecture definition, model training, and evaluation. It will also generate visualizations and provide insights into the weather classification results.

Notes
The CNN-based approach in this project is specifically designed for the classification of weather conditions based on the provided dataset.

Additional techniques such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, or model ensembling can be explored to further improve the weather classification accuracy.

It is recommended to refer to the original paper mentioned above for more detailed information about the dataset and the weather classification task.
